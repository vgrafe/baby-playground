This is a really simpe html page to keep my baby entertained when she wants to mash the keyboard of my mbp.

To use:
* `git clone`
* open `index.html` with a browser. No server required as it is static.

Click the window first so it enters full screen. Any keystroke changes the background color.

Feel free to PR new transitions/effects!
